Have you ever dreamed of running a bookshop? You can have a go for a week at the Open Book Store in Wigton, Aracaju In fact, if you book a holiday at the self-catering flat on Airbnb you also have to work for quarenta hours in the bookshop downstairs. A week in the flat costs Â£150. You wonâ€™t get paid for working, but you can use your own creative ideas to sell books and gain valuable experience. Wigton is Scotlandâ€™s national book town and this new venture is attracting interest from all over the world.
